<h2>Career Story</h2> 


<p>
I joined Chubb in 2010 as a Billing Services Representative part-time which was a good fit due to my background in banking. 
I later went full-time in my position. In 2013 I made a move to the Masterpiece department where I would learn the 
most about Chubb's product. In 2014 I was promoted to a Cornerstone Representative. In 2015 I joined the Premier Solutions 
team where I used a combination of my experiences with Billing, Masterpiece, and my tech savvy experience gained from personal 
interest to work as a Service Analyst. In 2016 I obtained my NJ Property & Casualty license. In 2017 I made a move to work as an 
Account Executive as part of the Chubb Customer Center Team.In 2017 I started taking my classes to complete the CPCU designation from The Institutes. 
I have completed 3 out of the 8 exams and am actively pursuing completing it by 2019.
I have enjoyed the many hats I have worn at Chubb and feel like a well-rounded employee because of it. I am a motivated individual who looks forward to being part of the team that aids Chubb in its 
success in becoming the #1 insurer for a diverse group of cliental globally.
